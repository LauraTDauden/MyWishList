# MyWishList âœ¨

This is a simple full stack app developed using Ionic + Angular + Express + Sequelize + MySQL to manage a small Wishlist. It consists of a simple CRUD that allows us to manage the items in our wishlist.
The backend is developed with Node.js and Express, using MySQL for the database, while the frontend is developed with Ionic and Angular.
